# This pet project of mine is a simple Treasury Yield Curve. I found that there were no live updating curves on the internet, and most seem to be either past data, or the data is in numbered/chart format with no visual. 
# For educational purposes, I pulled the data from CNBC and used a package that allowed me to create a dashboard in Python, in order to display the live changing yield prices of bonds. 
# Thank you for reading, and enjoy!
